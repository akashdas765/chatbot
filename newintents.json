It was the first educational institution in Mumbai run by a private management educational body. The college was declared open formally by H.E. Sir Roger Lumley, the then Governor of Bombay, on 3rd December 1937. A large amount of the credit of the establishment of this institution goes to Mataji Suvratadevi Ruia and her illustrious son, Seth Ramnivas Ramnarain Ruia, who extended a handsome donation of Rs.2,00,000 from the Ramnarain Harnandrai Charitable Trust."],
